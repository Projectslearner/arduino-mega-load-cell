# Load Cell

#### Project Overview

The **Load Cell** project demonstrates how to use a load cell with an Arduino Mega to measure weight. The HX711 module amplifies the load cell signal, allowing the Arduino to read and process it. This project reads the load cell values and prints the weight to the Serial Monitor after calibration.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Load Cell**
- **HX711 Amplifier Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Known Weight** (for calibration)

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Load Cell to the HX711 Amplifier Module:**
   - **Load Cell Wires**: Connect to the corresponding input terminals on the HX711 module.
   
2. **Connect the HX711 to Arduino Mega:**
   - **DOUT**: Connect to digital pin 3 on Arduino Mega.
   - **SCK**: Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the load cell to the HX711 module and then connect the HX711 module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Calibration:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Follow the instructions printed on the Serial Monitor to calibrate the load cell.
     - Remove all weight from the scale and wait for the prompt.
     - Place a known weight on the scale when prompted.
   - The calibration factor will be calculated and displayed in the Serial Monitor.
   - Use this calibration factor for accurate weight measurements.

4. **Testing:**
   - After calibration, the Serial Monitor will display the weight readings.
   - Ensure the readings are accurate by testing with known weights.

#### Applications

- **Weighing Scales:** Build a digital scale for various applications.
- **Force Measurement:** Measure force applied to the load cell in different scenarios.
- **Material Testing:** Determine the weight of materials in a laboratory or industrial setting.

#### Notes

- Ensure the load cell is properly mounted to avoid inaccurate readings.
- Use a stable and known weight for calibration to ensure accuracy.
- Calibration may need to be repeated if the load cell or HX711 module is moved or disturbed.
